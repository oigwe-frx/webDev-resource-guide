## Letter Spacing

The letter-spacing property is used to set the horizontal spacing between the individual characters in an element. It’s not common to set the spacing between letters, but it can sometimes help the readability of certain fonts or styles. The letter-spacing property takes length values in units, such as 2px or 0.5em.

```
p {
  letter-spacing: 2px;
}
```

In the example above, each character in the paragraph element will be separated by 2 pixels.


## Word Spacing
You can set the space between words with the word-spacing property. It’s also not common to increase the spacing between words, but it may help enhance the readability of bolded or enlarged text. The word-spacing property also takes length values in units, such as 3px or 0.2em.

```
h1 {
  word-spacing: 0.3em;
}
```

In the example above, the word spacing is set to 0.3em. For word spacing, using em values are recommended because the spacing can be set based on the size of the font.

## Line Height

We can use the line-height property to set how tall we want each line containing our text to be. Line height values can be a unitless number, such as 1.2, or a length value, such as 12px, 5% or 2em.

```
p {
  line-height: 1.4;
}
```

In the example above, the height between lines is set to 1.4. Generally, the unitless value is preferred since it is responsive based on the current font size. In other words, if the line-height is specified by a unitless number, changing the font size will automatically readjust the line height.


## Text Alignment
The text-align property, which you may already be familiar with from the CSS Visual Rules lesson, aligns text to its parent element.

```
h1 {
  text-align: right;
}
```
In the example above, the h1 element is aligned to the right side, instead of the default left.
  
 ## @Font-Face
 
 Fonts can also be added using a @font-face ruleset in your CSS stylesheet instead of using a link element in your HTML document.
 
 As mentioned earlier, fonts can be downloaded just like any other file on the web. They come in a few different file formats, such as:

- OTF (OpenType Font)
- TTF (TrueType Font)
- WOFF (Web Open Font Format)
- WOFF2 (Web Open Font Format 2)

The different formats are a progression of standards for how fonts will work with different browsers, with WOFF2 being the most progressive. It’s a good idea to include TTF, WOFF, and WOFF2 formats with your @font-face rule to ensure compatibility on all browsers.

Use the “Download” button to download the font files to your computer.
When you have the files you need, move them to a folder inside your website’s working directory, and you’re ready to use them in a @font-face ruleset!

```
@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyParagraphFont';
  src: url('fonts/Roboto.woff2') format('woff2'),
       url('fonts/Roboto.woff') format('woff'),
       url('fonts/Roboto.ttf') format('truetype');
}
```

Once the @font-face at-rule is defined, you can use the font in your stylesheet!

```
p {
  font-family: 'MyParagraphFont', sans-serif;
}
```
