## JavaScript and HTML

HTML defines the structure of a web page by using page elements as the building blocks. However, HTML by itself can not produce web page interactivity, that’s where JavaScript comes in.

Web programmers use JavaScript to make web pages dynamic and interactive. This powerful scripting language is encapsulated in its own HTML element: the script element. You can think of this script element as the door to JavaScript for HTML.

## The Script tag

The script element allows you to add JavaScript code inside an HTML file. Below, the script element embeds valid JavaScript code:

```
<h1>This is an embedded JS example/h1>
<script>
  function Hello() {
    alert ('Hello World');
  }
</script>
```
  
Frankly, without the script tag, websites would be unclickable and a bit boring.

The script element, like most elements in HTML, has an opening and closing angle bracket. The closing tag marks the end of the content inside of the script element. Just like the style tag used to embed CSS code, you use the script tag to embed valid JavaScript code.

## The src attribute

Since you know how to use a script element with embedded code, let’s talk about linking code. Linking code is preferable because of a programming concept called Separation of Concerns (SoC). Instead of having messy code that is all in the same file, web developers separate their code into different files, making each “concern” easier to understand and more convenient when changes must be made.

If the file is in the same project folder, the src value will be a relative path name. Below is an example of a providing a relative path for a JavaScript file.

```
<script src="./exampleScript.js"></script>
```

## How are scripts loaded?

Browsers come equipped with HTML parsers that help browsers render the elements accordingly. Elements, including the script element, are by default, parsed in the order they appear in the HTML file. When the HTML parser encounters a script element, it loads the script then executes its contents before parsing the rest of the HTML. The two main points to note here are that:

- The HTML parser does NOT process the next element in the HTML file until it loads and executes the script element, thus leading to a delay in load time and resulting in a poor user experience.
- Additionally, scripts are loaded sequentially, so if one script depends on another script, they should be placed in that very order inside the HTML file.
  
## Defer attribute

When the HTML parser comes across a script element, it stops to load its content. Once loaded, the JavaScript code is executed and the HTML parser proceeds to parse the next element in the file. This can result in a slow load time for your website. HTML4 introduced the defer and async attributes of the script element to address the user wait-time in the website based on different scenarios.

The defer attribute specifies scripts should be executed after the HTML file is completely parsed. When the HTML parser encounters a script element with the defer attribute, it loads the script but defers the actual execution of the JavaScript until after it finishes parsing the rest of the elements in the HTML file.

Here is an example of the defer tag:

```
<script src="example.js" defer></script> 
```
  
When is defer useful?

When a script contains functionality that requires interaction with the DOM, the defer attribute is the way to go. This way, it ensures that the entire HTML file has been parsed before the script is executed.
 
 
## Async attribute

The async attribute loads and executes the script asynchronously with the rest of the webpage. This means that, similar to the defer attribute, the HTML parser will continue parsing the rest of the HTML as the script is downloaded in the background. However, with the async attribute, the script will not wait until the entire page is parsed: it will execute immediately after it has been downloaded. Here is an example of the async tag:

```
<script src="example.js" async></script>
```
When is it useful?

async is useful for scripts that are independent of other scripts in order to function accordingly. Thus, if it does not matter exactly at which point the script file is executed, asynchronous loading is the most suitable option as it optimizes web page load time
