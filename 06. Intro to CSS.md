Cascading Style Sheets or CSS is a language web developers use to style the HTML content on a web page. If you’re interested in modifying colors, font types, font sizes, images, element positioning, and more, CSS is the tool for the job!

## CSS Anatomy

Declarations are the core of CSS. They apply a style to the selected element.

Ruleset Terms:

- —The beginning of the ruleset used to target the element that will be styled.
- Declaration Block—The code in-between (and including) the curly braces ({ }) that contains the CSS declaration(s).
- Declaration—The group name for a property and value pair that applies a style to the selected element.
- Property—The first part of the declaration that signifies what visual characteristic of the element is to be modified.
- Value—The second part of the declaration that signifies the value of the property.

Inline Style Terms:

- Opening Tag—The start of an HTML element. This is the element that will be styled.
- Attribute—The style attribute is used to add CSS inline styles to an HTML element.
- Declaration—The group name for a property and value pair that applies a style to the selected element.
- Property—The first part of the declaration that signifies what visual characteristic of the element is to be modified.
- Value—The second part of the declaration that signifies the value of the property.

## Inline Styles

Although CSS is a different language than HTML, it’s possible to write CSS code directly within HTML code using inline styles.

To style an HTML element, you can add the style attribute directly to the opening tag. After you add the attribute, you can set it equal to the CSS style(s) you’d like applied to that element.

```
<p style='color: red;'>I'm learning to code!</p>
```

If you’d like to add more than one style with inline styles, simply keep adding to the style attribute. Make sure to end the styles with a semicolon (;).

```
<p style='color: red; font-size: 20px;'>I'm learning to code!</p>
```

## Internal Stylesheet

HTML allows you to write CSS code in its own dedicated section with a style element nested inside of the head element. The CSS code inside the style element is often referred to as an internal stylesheet.

An internal stylesheet has certain benefits and use cases over inlines styles, but once again, it’s not best practice (we’ll get there, we promise). Understanding how to use internal stylesheets is nonetheless helpful knowledge to have.

To create an internal stylesheet, a style element must be placed inside of the head element.

```
<head>
  <style>
 
 
  </style>
</head>
```
  
After adding opening and closing style tags in the head section, you can begin writing CSS code.

```
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: red;
      font-size: 20px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```


## External Stylesheet

Developers avoid mixing code by storing HTML and CSS code in separate files (HTML files contain only HTML code, and CSS files contain only CSS code).

You can create an external stylesheet by using the .css file name extension, like so: style.css


## Linking the CSS File

```
<link href='./style.css' rel='stylesheet'>
```
