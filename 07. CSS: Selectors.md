## Type

A selector is used to target the specific HTML element(s) to be styled by the declaration. One selector you may already be familiar with is the type selector. Just like its name suggests, the type selector matches the type of the element in the HTML document.


```
p {
  color: green;
}
```

## Universal

Universal selector selects all elements of any type.
Targeting all of the elements on the page has a few specific use cases, such as resetting default browser styling, or selecting all children of a parent element. 
The universal selector uses the * character in the same place where you specified the type selector in a ruleset, like so:


```
* { 
  font-family: Verdana;
}
```

## Class

CSS is not limited to selecting elements by their type. 

```
<p class='brand'>Sole Shoe Company</p>
```

## Id

Oftentimes it’s important to select a single element with CSS to give it its own unique style. If an HTML element needs to be styled uniquely, we can give it an ID using the id attribute.

```
<h1 id='large-title'> ... </h1>
```

In contrast to class which accepts multiple values, and can be used broadly throughout an HTML document, an element’s id can only have a single value, and only be used once per page.


## Attributes

You may remember that some HTML elements use attributes to add extra detail or functionality to the element. Some familiar attributes may be href and src, but there are many more—including class and id!

The attribute selector can be used to target HTML elements that already contain attributes. Elements of the same type can be targeted differently by their attribute or attribute value. This alleviates the need to add new code, like the class or id attributes.

Attributes can be selected similarly to types, classes, and IDs.

```
[href]{
   color: magenta;
}
```

The most basic syntax is an attribute surrounded by square brackets. In the above example: [href] would target all elements with an href attribute and set the color to magenta.

And it can get more granular from there by adding type and/or attribute values. One way is by using type[attribute*=value]. In short, this code selects an element where the attribute contains any instance of the specified value. Let’s take a look at an example.

```
<img src='/images/seasons/cold/winter.jpg'>
<img src='/images/seasons/warm/summer.jpg'>
```
The HTML code above renders two <img> elements, each containing a src attribute with a value equaling a link to an image file.

```
img[src*='winter'] {
  height: 50px;
}
 
img[src*='summer'] {
  height: 100px;
}
```

## Pseudo Class

In fact, :focus, :visited, :disabled, and :active are all pseudo-classes. Factors such as user interaction, site navigation, and position in the DOM can all give elements a different state with pseudo-class.

A pseudo-class can be attached to any selector. It is always written as a colon : followed by a name. For example p:hover.

```
p:hover {
  background-color: lime;
}
```


## Classes and Ids

 CSS classes and IDs have different purposes, which can affect which one you use to style HTML elements.

CSS classes are meant to be reused over many elements. By writing CSS classes, you can style elements in a variety of ways by mixing classes. For instance, imagine a page with two headlines. One headline needs to be bold and blue, and the other needs to be bold and green. Instead of writing separate CSS rules for each headline that repeat each other’s code, it’s better to write a .bold CSS rule, a .green CSS rule, and a .blue CSS rule. Then you can give one headline the bold green classes, and the other the bold blue classes.

While classes are meant to be used many times, an ID is meant to style only one element. IDs override the styles of types and classes. Since IDs override these styles, they should be used sparingly and only on elements that need to always appear the same.


## Specificity

A best practice in CSS is to style elements while using the lowest degree of specificity so that if an element needs a new style, it is easy to override.

IDs are the most specific selector in CSS, followed by classes, and finally, type. For example, consider the following HTML and CSS:

```
<h1 class='headline'>Breaking News</h1>
h1 {
  color: red;
}
 
.headline {
  color: firebrick;
}

```
In the example code above, the color of the heading would be set to firebrick, as the class selector is more specific than the type selector. If an ID attribute (and selector) were added to the code above, the styles within the ID selector’s body would override all other styles for the heading.

Over time, as files grow with code, many elements may have IDs, which can make CSS difficult to edit since a new, more specific style must be created to change the style of an element.


## Chaining

When writing CSS rules, it’s possible to require an HTML element to have two or more CSS selectors at the same time.

This is done by combining multiple selectors, which we will refer to as chaining. For instance, if there was a special class for h1 elements, the CSS would look like below:

```
h1.special {
 
}
```

The code above would select only the h1 elements with a class of special. If a p element also had a class of special, the rule in the example would not style the paragraph.


## Descendant Combinator

CSS also supports selecting elements that are nested within other HTML elements, also known as descendants. For instance, consider the following HTML:

```
<ul class='main-list'>
  <li> ... </li>
  <li> ... </li>
  <li> ... </li>
</ul>
```

The nested li elements are descendants of the ul element and can be selected with the descendant combinator like so:

```
.main-list li {
 
}
```

Selecting elements in this way can make our selectors even more specific by making sure they appear in the context we expect.
