## What is the Redux API ?

Remember, Redux applications are built upon a one-way flow of data model and are managed by the store:

- The state is the set of data values that describes the application. It is used to render the user interface (UI).
- Users interact with the UI which dispatch actions to the store. An action is an object that expresses a desired change to the state.
- The store generates its next state using a reducer function which receives the most recent action and the current state as inputs.
- Finally, the UI is re-rendered based on the new state of the store and the entire process can begin again.

## Install Redux Library

```
npm install redux
```

```
import { createStore } from 'redux';
```

## Create a Redux Store

As you know, every Redux application uses a reducer function that describes which actions can update the state and how those actions lead to the next state.

```
const initialState = 'on';
const lightSwitchReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'toggle':
      return state === 'on' ? 'off' : 'on';
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

This reducer handles a single action type 'toggle' and returns the next state of the store: 'on' if it had been 'off' and vice-versa. If an unrecognized action is received, the current state of the store is returned.

The store is an object that enforces the one-way data flow model that Redux is built upon. It holds the current state inside, receives action dispatches, executes the reducer to get the next state, and provides access to the current state for the UI to re-render.

Redux exports a valuable helper function for creating this store object called createStore(). The createStore() helper function has a single argument, a reducer function.

To create a store with lightSwitchReducer, you could write:

```
import { createStore } from 'redux'
 
const initialState = 'on';
const lightSwitchReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'toggle':
      return state === 'on' ? 'off' : 'on';
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
 
const store = createStore(lightSwitchReducer);
```

## Dispatch Actions to the Store

The store object returned by createStore() provides a number of useful methods for interacting with its state as well as the reducer function it was created with.

The most commonly used method, store.dispatch(), can be used to dispatch an action to the store, indicating that you wish to update the state. Its only argument is an action object, which must have a type property describing the desired state change.

```
const action = { type: 'actionDescriptor' }; 
store.dispatch(action);
```
Each time store.dispatch() is called with an action object, the store’s reducer function will be executed with the same action object. Assuming that the action.type is recognized by the reducer, the state will be updated and returned.

```
import { createStore } from 'redux';
 
const initialState = 'on';
const lightSwitchReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'toggle':
      return state === 'on' ? 'off' : 'on';
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
 
const store = createStore(lightSwitchReducer);
 
console.log(store.getState()); // Prints 'on'
 
store.dispatch({ type: 'toggle' }); 
console.log(store.getState()); // Prints 'off'
 
store.dispatch({ type: 'toggle' });
console.log(store.getState()); // Prints 'on'
```

In this example, you can also see another store method, store.getState(), which returns the current value of the store’s state. Printing its value between each dispatched action allows us to see how the store’s state changes.

Internally, when the store executes its reducer, it uses store.getState() as the state argument. Though you won’t see it, you can imagine that, when an action is dispatched like this…

```
store.dispatch({ type: 'toggle'});
```

…the store calls the reducer like this:

```
lightSwitchReducer(store.getState(), { type: 'toggle' });
```


## Action Creators

In most Redux applications, action creators are used to reduce this repetition and to provide consistency. An action creator is simply a function that returns an action object with a type property. They are typically called and passed directly to the store.dispatch() method resulting in fewer errors and an easier-to-read dispatch statement.

Though not necessary in a Redux application, action creators save us the time needed to type out the entire action object, reduce the chances you make a typo, and improve the readability of our application.

```
const toggle = () => {
  return { type: "toggle" };
}
store.dispatch(toggle()); // Toggles the light to 'off'
store.dispatch(toggle()); // Toggles the light back to 'on'
store.dispatch(toggle()); // Toggles the light back to 'off'
```
