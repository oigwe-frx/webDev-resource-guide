## State

State is the current information behind a web application.

For a calendar application it includes:
- the events (name, date, label, etc.)
- the current timezone, and 
- the display filters. 

For a todo app it includes:
- the todo items (description, completed/not completed), 
- the current order of the items, and display filters. 

For a word editor, it includes:
- the contents of the document, 
- the print settings, and 
- comments.

With Redux, state can be any JavaScript type, including: number, string, boolean, array, and object.

```
const state = [ 'Print trail map', 'Pack snacks', 'Summit the mountain' ];
```

## Actions

Most well-designed applications will have separate components that need to communicate and share data with each other.

A todo list might have an input field where the user can type in a new todo item. The application might transfer this data from the input field, add it to an array of all todos, and then render them as text on the screen. This entire interaction can be defined as an action.
In Redux, actions are represented as plain JS objects.

```
const action = {
  type: 'todos/addTodo',
  payload: 'Take selfies'
};
```

- Every action must have a type property with a string value. This describes the action.
- Typically, an action has a payload property with an object value. This includes any information related to the action. In this case, the payload is the todo text.
- When an action is generated and notifies other parts of the application, we say that the action is dispatched.

```
const state = [ 'Take Five', 'Claire de Lune', 'Respect' ];
const addNewSong = {
  type: 'songs/addSong',
  payload: 'Halo'
};

const removeSong = {
  type: 'songs/removeSong',
  payload: 'Take Five'
};

const removeAll = {
  type: 'songs/removeAll'
};
```

## Reducers

A reducer, or reducer function, is a plain JavaScript function that defines how the current state and an action are used in combination to create the new state.


```
const initialState = [ 'Print trail map', 'Pack snacks', 'Summit the mountain' ];
 
const todoReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'todos/addTodo': {
      return [ ...state, action.payload];
    }
    case 'todos/removeAll': {
      return [];
    }
    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
}
```
There a few things about this reducer that are true for all reducers:

- It’s a plain JavaScript function
- It defines the application’s next state given a current state and a specific action
- It returns a default initial state if no action is provided
- It returns the current state if the action is not recognized

```
const initialState = [ 'Take Five', 'Claire de Lune', 'Respect' ];

const addNewSong = {
  type: 'songs/addSong',
  payload: 'Halo'
};

const removeSong = {
  type: 'songs/removeSong',
  payload: 'Take Five'
};

const removeAll = {
  type: 'songs/removeAll'
}

const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'songs/addSong': {
      return [...state, action.payload]
    }
    case 'songs/removeSong': {
      return [...state].filter((song) => song !== action.payload);
    }
    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
};
```

### Rules of Reducers

- They should only calculate the new state value based on the state and action arguments.
- They are not allowed to modify the existing state. Instead, they must copy the existing state and make changes to the copied values.
- They must not do any asynchronous logic or have other “side effects”.

By asynchronous logic or “side effects”, we mean anything that the function does aside from returning a value, e.g. logging to the console, saving a file, setting a timer, making an HTTP request, generating random numbers.

These rules make Redux code predictable and easy to debug: tests run reliably and other developers know what to expect from your code.
