## Preparing for HTML

HTML files require certain elements to set up the document properly. We can let web browsers know that we are using HTML by starting our document with a document type declaration.

The declaration looks like this:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

This declaration is an instruction, and it must be the first line of code in your HTML document. It tells the browser what type of document to expect, along with what version of HTML is being used in the document. For now, the browser will correctly assume that the html in <!DOCTYPE html> is referring to HTML5, as it is the current standard.

In the future, however, a new standard will override HTML5. To make sure your document is forever interpreted correctly, always include DOCTYPE html at the very beginning of your HTML documents.

Lastly, HTML code is always saved in a file with an .html extension


## html Tag

To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing html tags after declaring DOCTYPE html:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 
</html>
```
Anything between the opening html and closing html tags will be interpreted as HTML code. Without these tags, it’s possible that browsers could incorrectly interpret your HTML code.
  
  
## head tag

The head element contains the metadata for a web page. Metadata is information about the page that isn’t displayed directly on the web page. Unlike the information inside of the body tag, the metadata in the head is information about the page itself. 

### title tag

A browser’s tab displays the title specified in the title tag. The title tag is always inside of the head.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Coding Journal</title>
  </head>
</html>
```


## Opening Links in a New Window

The target attribute specifies how a link should open.

For a link to open in a new window, the target attribute requires a value of _blank. The target attribute can be added directly to the opening tag of the anchor element, just like the href attribute.

```
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank">The Brown Bear</a>
```

The target="_blank" attribute, when used in modern browsers, will open new websites in a new tab.


## Linking to Relative Page

HTML files are often stored in the same folder, as shown in the example above. If the browser is currently displaying index.html, it also knows that about.html and contact.html are in the same folder. Because the files are stored in the same folder, we can link web pages together using a relative path.

```
<a href="./contact.html">Contact</a>
```

The ./ in ./index.html tells the browser to look for the file in the current folder.


## Linking At Will

HTML allows you to turn nearly any element into a link by wrapping that element with an anchor element. With this technique, it’s possible to turn images into links by simply wrapping the element with an anchor tag element.

```
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.Prickly_Pear_Closeup.jpg" alt="A red prickly pear fruit"/></a>
```

## Linking to Same Page

When users visit our site, we want them to be able to click a link and have the page automatically scroll to a specific section.

In order to link to a target on the same page, we must give the target an id, like this:

```
<p id="top">This is the top of the page!</p>
<h1 id="bottom">This is the bottom! </h1>
```
An id should be descriptive to make it easier to remember the purpose of a link. The target link is a string containing the # character and the target element’s id.

```
<ol>
  <li><a href="#top">Top</a></li>
  <li><a href="#bottom">Bottom</a></li>
</ol>
```

## Comments
HTML files also allow you to add comments to your code.

Comments begin with <!-- and end with -->. Any characters in between will be ignored by your browser.

```
<!-- This is a comment that the browser will not display. -->
```
