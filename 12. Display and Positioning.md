## Position

Block-level elements like these boxes create a block the full width of their parent elements, and they prevent other elements from appearing in the same horizontal space.

Block-level elements also consistently appear on the left side of the browser. This is the default position for block-level elements.

The default position of an element can be changed by setting its position property. The position property can take one of five values:

- static - the default value (it does not need to be specified)
  -  Since static and relative positioned elements stay in the normal flow of the document, when a user scrolls the page (or parent element) these elements will scroll too.
- relative
  - This value allows you to position an element relative to its default static position on the web page. 
  - accompanying the position declaration with one or more of the following offset properties that will move the element away from its default static position:
    - top - moves the element down from the top.
    - bottom - moves the element up from the bottom.
    - left - moves the element away from the left side (to the right).
    - right - moves the element away from the right side (to the left).
  - Since static and relative positioned elements stay in the normal flow of the document, when a user scrolls the page (or parent element) these elements will scroll too.
- absolute
  - When an element’s position is set to absolute, all other elements on the page will ignore the element and act like it is not present on the page. 
  - The element will be positioned relative to its closest positioned parent element, while offset properties can be used to determine the final position from there.
  - fixed and absolute positioned elements are removed from the document flow, when a user scrolls, these elements will stay at their specified offset position.
- fixed
  - We can fix an element to a specific position on the page (regardless of user scrolling) by setting its position to fixed, and accompanying it with the familiar offset properties top, bottom, left, and right.
  - fixed and absolute positioned elements are removed from the document flow, when a user scrolls, these elements will stay at their specified offset position.
- sticky
  - The sticky value is another position value that keeps an element in the document flow as the user scrolls, but sticks to a specified position as the page is scrolled further.
  - This is done by using the sticky value along with the familiar offset properties, as well as one new one. 


## Z-Index

The z-index property controls how far back or how far forward an element should appear on the web page when elements overlap.

This can be thought of as the depth of elements, with deeper elements appearing behind shallower elements.

The z-index property accepts integer values. Depending on their values, the integers instruct the browser on the order in which elements should be layered on the web page.

```
.blue-box {
  background-color: blue;
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}
 
.green-box {
  background-color: green;
  position: relative;
  top: -170px;
  left: 170px;
}
```
In the example above, we set the .blue-box position to relative and the z-index to 1. We changed position to relative, because the z-index property does not work on static elements. The z-index of 1 moves the .blue-box element forward, because the z-index value has not been explicitly specified for the .green-box element, which means it has a default z-index value of 0.

## In-line Display

The default display for some elements, such as em, strong, and a, is called inline.
- Inline elements have a box that wraps tightly around their content, only taking up the amount of space necessary to display their content and not requiring a new line after each element. 
- The height and width of these elements cannot be specified in the CSS document. For example, the text of an anchor tag will, by default, be displayed on the same line as the surrounding text, and it will only be as wide as necessary to contain its content. 
- Inline elements cannot be altered in size with the height or width CSS properties.

The CSS display property provides the ability to make any element an inline element. This includes elements that are not inline by default such as paragraphs, divs, and headings.

```
h1 {
  display: inline;
}
```

## Block Display

Some elements are not displayed in the same line as the content around them. These are called block-level elements.

These elements fill the entire width of the page by default, but their width property can also be set. Unless otherwise specified, they are the height necessary to accommodate their content.

Elements that are block-level by default include all levels of heading elements (h1 through h6), p, div and footer


## Inline-Block Display

Inline-block display combines features of both inline and block elements.

Inline-block elements can appear next to each other and we can specify their dimensions using the width and height properties.


## Float

If you’re simply interested in moving an element as far left or as far right as possible in the container, you can use the float property.

The float property is commonly used for wrapping text around an image while moving elements left and right for layout purposes is better left to tools like CSS grid and flexbox, which you’ll learn about later on.

The float property is often set using one of the values below:

- left - moves, or floats, elements as far left as possible.
- right - moves elements as far right as possible.



## Clear

The float property can also be used to float multiple elements at once. However, when multiple floated elements have different heights, it can affect their layout on the page. Specifically, elements can “bump” into each other and not allow other elements to properly move to the left or right.

The clear property specifies how elements should behave when they bump into each other on the page. It can take on one of the following values:

- left—the left side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element.
- right—the right side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element.
- both—neither side of the element will touch any other element within the same containing element.
- none—the element can touch either side.
