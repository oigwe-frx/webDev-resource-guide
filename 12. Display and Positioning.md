## Position

Block-level elements like these boxes create a block the full width of their parent elements, and they prevent other elements from appearing in the same horizontal space.

Block-level elements also consistently appear on the left side of the browser. This is the default position for block-level elements.

The default position of an element can be changed by setting its position property. The position property can take one of five values:

- static - the default value (it does not need to be specified)
-   Since static and relative positioned elements stay in the normal flow of the document, when a user scrolls the page (or parent element) these elements will scroll too.
- relative
  - This value allows you to position an element relative to its default static position on the web page. 
  - accompanying the position declaration with one or more of the following offset properties that will move the element away from its default static position:
    - top - moves the element down from the top.
    - bottom - moves the element up from the bottom.
    - left - moves the element away from the left side (to the right).
    - right - moves the element away from the right side (to the left).
  - Since static and relative positioned elements stay in the normal flow of the document, when a user scrolls the page (or parent element) these elements will scroll too.
- absolute
  - When an elementâ€™s position is set to absolute, all other elements on the page will ignore the element and act like it is not present on the page. 
  - The element will be positioned relative to its closest positioned parent element, while offset properties can be used to determine the final position from there.
  - fixed and absolute positioned elements are removed from the document flow, when a user scrolls, these elements will stay at their specified offset position.
- fixed
  - We can fix an element to a specific position on the page (regardless of user scrolling) by setting its position to fixed, and accompanying it with the familiar offset properties top, bottom, left, and right.
  - fixed and absolute positioned elements are removed from the document flow, when a user scrolls, these elements will stay at their specified offset position.
- sticky
  - The sticky value is another position value that keeps an element in the document flow as the user scrolls, but sticks to a specified position as the page is scrolled further.
  - This is done by using the sticky value along with the familiar offset properties, as well as one new one. 


## Z-Index

The z-index property controls how far back or how far forward an element should appear on the web page when elements overlap.

This can be thought of as the depth of elements, with deeper elements appearing behind shallower elements.

The z-index property accepts integer values. Depending on their values, the integers instruct the browser on the order in which elements should be layered on the web page.

```
.blue-box {
  background-color: blue;
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}
 
.green-box {
  background-color: green;
  position: relative;
  top: -170px;
  left: 170px;
}
```
In the example above, we set the .blue-box position to relative and the z-index to 1. We changed position to relative, because the z-index property does not work on static elements. The z-index of 1 moves the .blue-box element forward, because the z-index value has not been explicitly specified for the .green-box element, which means it has a default z-index value of 0.
