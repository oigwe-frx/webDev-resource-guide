# What is Web Development?

## HTML

HTML is the skeleton of all web pages. It provides structure to the content on a website, including text, images, buttons, videos, and more.
HTML stands for hypertext markup language. 


The ML in HTML stands for markup language. Markup refers to a way of annotating text that is distinguishable from the text itself. The same way that a teacher might “markup” a student essay by underlining topic sentences and 
circling spelling errors, HTML annotates the content within a web page. HTML separates content and annotation by using HTML tags, which are denoted by angle brackets (also known as less-than and greater-than signs).

The H and T in HTML stands for hypertext. Hypertext is text that is linked to other text. The prefix hyper indicates that the text expands beyond the traditional constraints of the written word. Instead of reading documents from beginning to end, like you would read a book, someone going through hypertext can browse. By clicking on links from one document to another, the user can navigate to whatever page they find the most interesting and carve their own unique path through the web.

### HTML Elements

HTML tags are the “markup” for HTML. They are annotations that provide information about the type of content they contain. 
A paragraph element is made up of one opening tag (<p></p>), the content (“Hello World!” text), and a closing tag (</p>).


### Adding Hyperlinks

An attribute in HTML provides additional information about an HTML element. It comes in a name and value pair with the structure name="value". For example, you can specify the width of an HTML element with the attribute width="500".
Links are created in HTML with something called the href attribute, which stands for hyperlink reference. The href attribute allows us to specify the URL, or address on the web, that a link should take users to. See below for an example of the href attribute in action.

When we set the href property on an anchor tag (abbreviated to <a></a>) we can specify both the text that should be rendered for the user (the text within the anchor tag) and the URL that the browser should navigate to.
  

## CSS

CSS is the language that provides style to the content of an HTML page. This includes colors, fonts, positioning, layout, and more!
Why do we need a separate language for content and presentation? This is an example of the computer science principle separation of concerns. Large codebases are kept maintainable when each section has clearly differentiated problems that it is trying to solve.

Since the styling rules are described separately from the content itself, if Alejandra adds more paragraphs, images, or other forms of content, she can expect them to be styled the same way as her existing content. This will save Alejandra time in the long run, especially as her website gets more and more complex.

## Javascript

Any website that provides more than just static information probably utilizes JavaScript in some way. Here are some familiar examples of website features most often built with JavaScript:

- popup ads
- animated graphics (2D or 3D)
- interactive audio and video
- maps and other features access the user’s geographic location

One of the defining features of JavaScript is its ability to respond to browser events. These events happen in real time and can be triggered by a wide variety of user interactions, including:

- the user clicking on a button
- the user pressing enter on their keyboard
- a video file finishing loading
- the user re-sizing their window
- the user hovering over text on the webpage


## SQL

SQL, which stands for structured query language.
SQL stores information in tables, which is simply a collection of information organized into rows and columns.
To get the information, you would write a query, or a program that would retrieve data from the table.

Here’s an example of a query that would select all of the columns —the * keyword is a shorthand for “all”— from the page_views table:

```
SELECT * FROM page_views;
```
