## What is Flexbox?

There are two important components to a flexbox layout: flex containers and flex items. A flex container is an element on a page that contains flex items. All direct child elements of a flex container are flex items. This distinction is important because some of the properties you will learn in this lesson apply to flex containers while others apply to flex items.

To designate an element as a flex container, set the element’s display property to flex or inline-flex. Once an item is a flex container, there are several properties we can use to specify how its children behave. In this lesson we will cover these properties:

- justify-content
- align-items
- flex-grow
- flex-shrink
- flex-basis
- flex
- flex-wrap
- align-content
- flex-direction
- flex-flow

Flexbox is an elegant tool that makes it easy to address positioning issues that may have been difficult before. Let’s get started!

## display: flex
Any element can be a flex container. Flex containers are helpful tools for creating websites that respond to changes in screen sizes. Child elements of flex containers will change size and location in response to the size and position of their parent container.

For an element to become a flex container, its display property must be set to flex.

```
div.container {
  display: flex;
}
```
In the example above, all divs with the class container are flex containers. If they have children, the children are flex items. A div with the declaration display: flex; will remain block level — no other elements will appear on the same line as it.

However, it will change the behavior of its child elements. Child elements will not begin on new lines. In the exercises that follow, we will cover how the flex display property impacts the positioning of child elements.

## inline-flex
In the previous exercise, you might have observed that when we gave a div — a block level element — the display value of flex that it remained a block level element. What if we want multiple flex containers to display inline with each other?

If we didn’t want div elements to be block-level elements, we would use display: inline. Flexbox, however, provides the inline-flex value for the display property, which allows us to create flex containers that are also inline elements.

```
<div class='container'>
  <p>I’m inside of a flex container!</p>
  <p>A flex container’s children are flex items!</p>
</div>
<div class='container'>
  <p>I’m also a flex item!</p>
  <p>Me too!</p>
</div>
.container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  display: inline-flex;
}
```
In the example above, there are two container divs. Without a width, each div would stretch the entire width of the page. The paragraphs within each div would also display on top of each other because paragraphs are block-level elements.

When we change the value of the display property to inline-flex, the divs will display inline with each other if the page is wide enough. As we progress through this lesson, we will cover in more detail how flex items are displayed.

Notice that in the example above, the size of the flex container is set. Currently, the size of the parent container will override the size of its child elements. If the parent element is too small, the flex items will shrink to accommodate the parent container’s size. We’ll explain why in a later exercise.

```
<div class='container'>
  <div class='child'>
    <h1>1</h1>
  </div>
  <div class='child'>
    <h1>2</h1>
  </div>
</div>
.container {
  width: 200px;
}
 
.child {
  display: inline-flex;
  width: 150px;
  height: auto;
}
```
In the example above, the .child divs will take up more width (300 pixels) than the container div allows (200 pixels). The .child divs will shrink to accommodate the container’s size. In later exercises, we will explore several ways to handle this.
