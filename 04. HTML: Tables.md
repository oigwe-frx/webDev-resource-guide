## Create a Table

Before displaying data, we must first create the table that will contain the data by using the table element.

```
<table>
 
</table>
```

## Table Rows


The first step in entering data into the table is to add rows using the table row element: tr.

```
<table>
  <tr>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  </tr>
</table>
```

## Table Data

Rows aren’t sufficient to add data to a table. Each cell element must also be defined. In HTML, you can add data using the table data element: td.

```
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>73</td>
    <td>81</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
```


## Table Headings
Table data doesn’t make much sense without titles to describe what the data represents.

To add titles to rows and columns, you can use the table heading element: th.

The table heading element is used just like a table data element, except with a relevant title. Just like table data, a table heading must be placed within a table row.

```
<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th scope="col">Saturday</th>
    <th scope="col">Sunday</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Temperature</th>
    <td>73</td>
    <td>81</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

When rendered, this code will appear similar to the image below:

Note, also, the use of the scope attribute, which can take one of two values:

- row - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a row.
- col - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a column.

## Table Borders

We use CSS to add style to HTML documents, because it helps us to separate the structure of a page from how it looks. You can learn more about CSS in our CSS courses.

You can achieve the same table border effect using CSS.

```
table, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

## Spanning Columns

What if the table contains data that spans multiple columns?

For example, a personal calendar could have events that span across multiple hours, or even multiple days.

Data can span columns using the colspan attribute. The attributes accepts an integer (greater than or equal to 1) to denote the number of columns it spans across.

```
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Monday</th>
    <th>Tuesday</th>
    <th>Wednesday</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">Out of Town</td>
    <td>Back in Town</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```


## Spanning Rows

Data can also span multiple rows using the rowspan attribute.

The rowspan attribute is used for data that spans multiple rows (perhaps an event goes on for multiple hours on a certain day). It accepts an integer (greater than or equal to 1) to denote the number of rows it spans across.

```
<table>
  <tr> <!-- Row 1 -->
    <th></th>
    <th>Saturday</th>
    <th>Sunday</th>
  </tr>
  <tr> <!-- Row 2 -->
    <th>Morning</th>
    <td rowspan="2">Work</td>
    <td rowspan="3">Relax</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> <!-- Row 3 -->
    <th>Afternoon</th>
  </tr>
  <tr> <!-- Row 4 -->
    <th>Evening</th>
    <td>Dinner</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

## Table Body

Over time, a table can grow to contain a lot of data and become very long. When this happens, the table can be sectioned off so that it is easier to manage.

Long tables can be sectioned off using the table body element: tbody.

The tbody element should contain all of the table’s data, excluding the table headings (more on this in a later exercise).

```
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Saturday</th>
      <th>Sunday</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Morning</th>
      <td rowspan="2">Work</td>
      <td rowspan="3">Relax</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Afternoon</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Evening</th>
      <td>Dinner</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```


## Table Head

When a table’s body is sectioned off, however, it also makes sense to section off the table’s column headings using the thead element.

 ```
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th scope="col">Saturday</th>
      <th scope="col">Sunday</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Morning</th>
      <td rowspan="2">Work</td>
      <td rowspan="3">Relax</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th scope="row">Afternoon</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Evening</th>
      <td>Dinner</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

The table headings are contained inside of this element. Note that the table’s head still requires a row in order to contain the table headings.

Additionally, only the column headings go under the thead element. We can use the scope attribute on th elements to indicate whether a th element is being used as a "row" heading or a "col" heading.

## Table Footer

The bottom part of a long table can also be sectioned off using the tfoot element.

```
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Quarter</th>
      <th>Revenue</th>
      <th>Costs</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Q1</th>
      <td>$10M</td>
      <td>$7.5M</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Q2</th>
      <td>$12M</td>
      <td>$5M</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <th>Total</th>
      <td>$22M</td>
      <td>$12.5M</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>
```

In the example above, the footer contains the totals of the data in the table. Footers are often used to contain sums, differences, and other data results.
