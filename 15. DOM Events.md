## Event Handler Registration

Using the .addEventListener() method, we can have a DOM element listen for a specific event and execute a block of code when the event is detected. The DOM element that listens for an event is called the event target and the block of code that runs when the event happens is called the event handler.

Let’s take a look at the code below:

```
let eventTarget = document.getElementById('targetElement');
 
eventTarget.addEventListener('click', function() {
  // this block of code will run when click event happens on eventTarget element
});
```

Instead of using an anonymous function as the event handler, it’s best practice to create a named event handler function. Your code will remain organized and reusable this way, even if your code gets complex. Check out the syntax:

```
function eventHandlerFunction() {
  // this block of code will run when click event happens
}
 
eventTarget.addEventListener('click', eventHandlerFunction);
```
