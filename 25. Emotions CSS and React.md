## Intro

Emotion is a library designed for writing css styles with JavaScript. It provides powerful and predictable style composition in addition to a great developer experience with features such as source maps, labels, and testing utilities. Both string and object styles are supported.

## Installing the Packages
There are two primary ways of using Emotion: framework-agnostic or specifically with React.

The @emotion/css package is framework agnostic and the simplest way to use Emotion. 
- It is the recommended way to use Emotion with a non React app.

It is best to use the “@emotion/react” package when using React with a build environment that can be configured.


## The css Prop
The css prop allows you to style elements. 
It can support an object or a tagged template literal. 

At the top of the App.js file, import the css prop from emotion. 
- Include the comment /** @jsxImportSource @emotion/react */ at the top of the file when using Create React App 4. 
  - This comment informs Babel to customize the automatic runtime import.
  
```
/** @jsxImportSource @emotion/react */
import { css } from "@emotion/react";
```

## Object Styles

Instead of writing CSS properties in kebab-case, like regular CSS, you write them in camelCase. Notice properties are separated by a comma. Object styles are especially helpful because you don’t need a CSS call like with string styles but object styles can also be used with styled components.

```
<main
  css={{
    color: "#03045e",
    background: "#caf0f8",
    height: "1200px",
    fontFamily: "helvetica",
  }}
>
  ...
</main>
```

## String Styles

The css prop also used tagged template literals. 
Template literals are enclosed by the backtick (` `). 
Notice the css properties are written in kebab-case and separated by a semicolon.


```
<img
  src={logo}
  alt="logo"
  css={css`
    display: absolute;
    margin-top: 15px;
    margin-left: 15px;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
  `}
/>
```

## Styled Components

The Emotion library has a package called @emotion/styled, which gives us access to styled, that allows you to create components that have styles attached to them. 
It is similar to css prop except it is called with an HTML tag or React component.

To install the styled package from the Emotion library, run the following command:

```
npm i @emotion/styled
```
