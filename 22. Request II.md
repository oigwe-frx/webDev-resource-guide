## Requests w/ ES6

To make asynchronous event handling easier, promises were introduced in JavaScript in ES6:

A promise is an object that handles asynchronous data. A promise has three states:

-pending : when a promise is created or waiting for data.
-fulfilled : the asynchronous operation was handled successfully.
-rejected : the asynchronous operation was unsuccessful.

The great thing about promises is that once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, you can chain an additional method to the original promise.

In this lesson, we will explain how to use fetch(), which uses promises to handle requests. Then, we will simplify requests using async and await.

## fetch() GET Requests I

The fetch() function:

```
- Creates a request object that contains relevant information that an API needs.
- Sends that request object to the API endpoint provided.
- Returns a promise that ultimately resolves to a response object, which contains the status of the promise with information the API sent back.

```
## fetch() Get Request II
### Example
```
fetch('https://api-to-call.com/endpoint') //This first argument determines the endpoint of the request.
.then(response => { //The success callback function takes one parameter, response .then() will fire only after the promise status of fetch() has been resolved.
  if (response.ok) { //The reason weâ€™re testing the ok property of the response object is that it will be a Boolean value. If there were no errors response.ok will be true and then your code will return response.json().
    return response.json();
  }
  throw new Error('Request failed!');
}, networkError => { //If we could not reach the endpoint at all, e.g., the server is down, then we would get this networkError.
  console.log(networkError.message);
}).then(jsonResponse => {
  return jsonResponse;
});
```
