## HTTP Requests

One of JavaScript’s greatest assets is that it is an asynchronous language.
Generally, a site’s code is written so that users don’t have to wait for a giant image to load before being allowed to read the actual article—rather, that text is rendered first and then the image can load in the background.

JavaScript uses an event loop to handle asynchronous function calls. When a program is run, function calls are made and added to a stack. The functions that make requests that need to wait for servers to respond then get sent to a separate queue. Once the stack has cleared, then the functions in the queue are executed.

Web developers use the event loop to create a smoother browsing experience by deciding when to call functions and how to handle asynchronous events.

## XHR GET Requests I

Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), enables requests to be made after the initial page load. Initially, AJAX was used only for XML formatted data, now it can be used to make requests that have many different formats.

## XHR GET Requests II
```
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest;
const url = 'https://api-to-call.com/endpoint';

xhr.responseType = 'json';//JSON is JavaScript Object Notation, which is how the response is going to be formatted.


xhr.onreadystatechange = (() => {
  if (xhr.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {  //The purpose of this conditional statement checks to see if the request has finished.
  return xhr.response;
}
})
xhr.open('GET', url) //creates a new request and the arguments passed in determine the type and URL of the request.
xhr.send()
```

## XHR GET Requests III
### Example

```
// Information to reach API
const url = 'https://api.datamuse.com/words?';

const queryParams = 'rel_rhy='

// Selecting page elements
const inputField = document.querySelector('#input');
const submit = document.querySelector('#submit');
const responseField = document.querySelector('#responseField');

// AJAX function
const getSuggestions = () => {
  const wordQuery = inputField.value;
  const endpoint = `${url}${queryParams}${wordQuery}`;
  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.responseType = 'json';
  xhr.onreadystatechange = (() => {
    if (xhr.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {
  renderResponse(xhr.response)
}
  })
xhr.open('GET', endpoint);
xhr.send()
}

// Clear previous results and display results to webpage
const displaySuggestions = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  while(responseField.firstChild){
    responseField.removeChild(responseField.firstChild);
  };
  getSuggestions();
}

submit.addEventListener('click', displaySuggestions);
```
## XHR GET Requests IV

A query string contains additional information to be sent with a request
A query string is separated from the URL using a ? character. After ?, you can then create a parameter which is a key value pair joined by a =. Examine the example below:

```
'https://api.datamuse.com/words?key=value'
```

If you want to add an additional parameter you will have to use the & character to separate your parameters. Like so:

```
'https://api.datamuse.com/words?key=value&anotherKey=anotherValue'
```

## XHR POST Requests I
The major difference between a GET request and POST request is that a POST request requires additional information to be sent through the request. This additional information is sent in the body of the post request.

## XHR POST Requests II
### Example

```
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
const url = 'https://api-to-call.com/endpoint';
const data = JSON.stringify({id: '200'}); //JSON.stringify() will convert a value to a JSON string. By converting the value to a string, we can then send the data to a server.


xhr.responseType ='json';

xhr.onreadystatechange = () => {
  if (xhr.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE){
      return xhr.response;
  }
}
xhr.open('POST', url);
xhr.send(data);
```
