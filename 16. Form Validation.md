## Why Validate Forms?

Most data, once submitted, is stored by a website or web application. It’s stored in a database on the server side. 
There are important reasons for us to make sure the information that will be stored in the database is accurate.
- We want operations that depend on the data to work: 
  - Allowing a user to enter an incorrectly formatted email address, either on purpose or by accident, means that we won’t be able to contact that user later. 
  - Allowing a user to sign up for an account with a username that is already in use could cause numerous errors down the line. 
  - We want to keep our site secure: Unprotected data leaves entry points for malicious actors to hurt our application or our users. 
    - Allowing a user to submit a non-secure password means that their account will not be protected. 
    - Unprotected forms can also allow bits of code to be injected into our servers. 
      - This can potentially leave our users’ sensitive information exposed. 
      - The malicious actor could even gain control of our site or corrupt our existing data!


## Regular Expressions

Computers have to be precisely programmed to recognize patterns. 
To specify patterns for the computer to recognize, we use a special language called _regular expressions_—also known as regex or regexp. 
A regular expression is a sequence of characters representing a pattern. 
We can use that pattern to match a string, match parts of a string, confirm that data is formatted acceptably, or even replace parts of strings with different characters.


## Client-side Validation: HTML

The first technique we can use to validate form data is to prevent problematic inputs from being submitted in the first place. This is called client-side validation. The client is the process interacting with the server on behalf of a user—in the case of websites, the web browser is the client. The logic for validating the form is included with the code that displays the form on the user’s device. No interaction with the back-end is required to perform client-side validations.
Since form validation is so common, modern HTML provides some of these validation features built-in. For example, we can use HTML to make parts of a form required and others optional. We can also use HTML to set minimum and maximum values for an input or minimum or maximum lengths for a text input. We can even necessitate that the input match a particular pattern, specified by a regular expression.
If any of the rules laid out in the HTML form validation aren’t followed, the user will not be able to submit their form, and they’ll receive an error message explaining why. With these checks in place, the back-end is less likely to be sent incorrect data. HTML form validation will also benefit the user—the client provides the user immediate feedback, without having to wait for time-consuming communication with the back-end.

<input id="name" name="name" type="text" required minlength="3" maxlength="100">
