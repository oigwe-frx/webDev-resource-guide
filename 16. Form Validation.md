## Why Validate Forms?

Most data, once submitted, is stored by a website or web application. It’s stored in a database on the server side. 
There are important reasons for us to make sure the information that will be stored in the database is accurate.
- We want operations that depend on the data to work: 
  - Allowing a user to enter an incorrectly formatted email address, either on purpose or by accident, means that we won’t be able to contact that user later. 
  - Allowing a user to sign up for an account with a username that is already in use could cause numerous errors down the line. 
  - We want to keep our site secure: Unprotected data leaves entry points for malicious actors to hurt our application or our users. 
    - Allowing a user to submit a non-secure password means that their account will not be protected. 
    - Unprotected forms can also allow bits of code to be injected into our servers. 
      - This can potentially leave our users’ sensitive information exposed. 
      - The malicious actor could even gain control of our site or corrupt our existing data!


## Regular Expressions

Computers have to be precisely programmed to recognize patterns. 
To specify patterns for the computer to recognize, we use a special language called _regular expressions_—also known as regex or regexp. 
A regular expression is a sequence of characters representing a pattern. 
We can use that pattern to match a string, match parts of a string, confirm that data is formatted acceptably, or even replace parts of strings with different characters.


## Client-side Validation: HTML

The first technique we can use to validate form data is to prevent problematic inputs from being submitted in the first place. This is called client-side validation. The client is the process interacting with the server on behalf of a user—in the case of websites, the web browser is the client. The logic for validating the form is included with the code that displays the form on the user’s device. No interaction with the back-end is required to perform client-side validations.
Since form validation is so common, modern HTML provides some of these validation features built-in. For example, we can use HTML to make parts of a form required and others optional. We can also use HTML to set minimum and maximum values for an input or minimum or maximum lengths for a text input. We can even necessitate that the input match a particular pattern, specified by a regular expression.

If any of the rules laid out in the HTML form validation aren’t followed, the user will not be able to submit their form, and they’ll receive an error message explaining why. With these checks in place, the back-end is less likely to be sent incorrect data. HTML form validation will also benefit the user—the client provides the user immediate feedback, without having to wait for time-consuming communication with the back-end.

```
<input id="name" name="name" type="text" required minlength="3" maxlength="100">
```

## Client-side Validation: JavaScript

Client-side validation has two main advantages. 
- First, it’s a better experience for the user to be alerted to problematic data immediately rather than having to wait for that information to come back from the server and have to fill out the form again. 
- Second, catching mistakes earlier in the process saves the application time and resources as well. But not all issues can be handled with the built-in HTML validations.

In order to truly customize validation or to perform more complex validations, we can incorporate JavaScript form validations. We can do this by either writing the JavaScript ourselves or by incorporating a JavaScript library. If we have unique requirements for usernames on our site, for example, we’ll have to provide these systems of validation ourselves.

If we’re creating a relatively simple website, it makes sense to code the form validation ourselves or use a simple vanilla JavaScript library—just-validate, for example. But most basic validation libraries will involve directly accessing or manipulating the DOM. This can get tricky when working with a framework that relies on a virtual DOM—like React or Vue. In those situations, it might be best to incorporate a library that works well with your specific framework. For example, the formik library is a lightweight library that simplifies validating forms in a React app.


## Back-end Validation

No matter how complete the front-end validation of a website or application seems, validations must also be completed on the back-end or server-side. Front-end validations are easy to bypass—a malicious user can simply turn off JavaScript on their browser, for example. There’s also the potential for middleman attacks in which data is changed after the request is submitted by a user but before it arrives at the server. As a rule, the back-end should never trust the data it receives.

As the developer, once data is in the back-end, we have complete control over it, luckily. Back-end validation has several advantages:

- It enables us to use validation code often on machines with more computing power.
- It allows us to write validation code that a user can’t see—if malicious users can’t see exactly how we validate the data, it’s much more difficult for them to find ways around it.
- We can validate the information against other data the front-end doesn’t have access to—for example, we can check our database to see if a given username is already in use.
- 
There are two main ways to validate inputs on the server-side. The first takes place while the user is still inputting data into the form on the front-end. We can make asynchronous requests to the server with pieces of their data and send feedback directly to the user before they’ve submitted. This is slower than front-end validation and can be a design challenge from a user-experience perspective.

The second is once the form has been submitted. Back-end form validation is our application’s last defense against problematic data, and it’s essential to verify the validity and safety of data before adding it to a database. This is also an opportunity to “sanitize” the data: in order for our database to be useful, it’s important that all data within it is formatted consistently. This means that while we may want to be flexible about the formatting we require from a user, we likely want to transform inputs into a strict format before entering them in the database.

## Number Input
There are a variety of input types
- <input type="button">
- <input type="checkbox">
- <input type="color">
- <input type="date">
- <input type="datetime-local">
- <input type="email">
- <input type="file">
- <input type="hidden">
- <input type="image">
- <input type="month">
- <input type="password">
- <input type="radio">
- <input type="range">
- <input type="reset">
- <input type="search">
- <input type="submit">
- <input type="tel">
- <input type="text">
- <input type="time">
-  <input type="url">
-  <input type="week">

But, we might want our users to type in a number — in which case we can set the type attribute to… (you guessed it)… "number"!

By setting type="number" for an <input> we can restrict what users type into the input field to just numbers (and a few special characters like -, +, and .). We can also provide a step attribute which creates arrows inside the input field to increase or decrease by the value of the step attribute. Below is the code needed to render an input field for numbers:

```
<form>
  <label for="years"> Years of experience: </label>
  <input id="years" name="years" type="number" step="1">
</form>
```
Which renders: rendered number input field with arrows to the right hand side of the field

## Range Input
Using an <input type="number"> is great if we want to allow users to type in any number of their choosing. But, if we wanted to limit what numbers our users could type we might consider using a different type value. Another option we could use is setting type to "range" which creates a slider.

To set the minimum and maximum values of the slider we assign values to the min and max attribute of the <input>. We could also control how smooth and fluid the slider works by assigning the step attribute a value. Smaller step values will make the slider more fluidly, whereas larger step values will make the slider move more noticeably. Take a look at the code to create a slider:

```
<form>
  <label for="volume"> Volume Control</label>
  <input id="volume" name="volume" type="range" min="0" max="100" step="1">
</form>
```
The code above renders:

## Checkbox Input
So far the types of inputs we’ve allowed were all single choices. But, what if we presented multiple options to users and allow them to select any number of options? Sounds like we could use checkboxes! In a form we would use the <input> element and set type="checkbox". Examine the code used to create multiple checkboxes:

 ```
<form>
  <p>Choose your pizza toppings:</p>
  <label for="cheese">Extra cheese</label>
  <input id="cheese" name="topping" type="checkbox" value="cheese">
  <br>
  <label for="pepperoni">Pepperoni</label>
  <input id="pepperoni" name="topping" type="checkbox" value="pepperoni">
  <br>
  <label for="anchovy">Anchovy</label>
  <input id="anchovy" name="topping" type="checkbox" value="anchovy">
</form>
```
Which renders:HTML form asking user to select pizza toppings and three topping selections as checkboxes
  ![](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html-forms/checkboxInput%20-%20labeled.png)

Notice in the example provided:

- there are assigned values to the value attribute of the checkboxes. These values are not visible on the form itself, that’s why it is important that we use an associated label to identify the checkbox.
- each input has the same value for the name attribute. Using the same name for each checkbox groups the inputs together. However, each <input> has a unique id to pair with a label.
  
 ## Radio Button Input
Checkboxes work well if we want to present users with multiple options and let them choose one or more of the options. However, there are cases where we want to present multiple options and only allow for one selection — like asking users if they agree or disagree with the terms and conditions. Let’s look over the code used to create radio buttons:

```
<form>
  <p>What is sum of 1 + 1?</p>
  <input type="radio" id="two" name="answer" value="2">
  <label for="two">2</label>
  <br>
  <input type="radio" id="eleven" name="answer" value="11">
  <label for="eleven">11</label>
</form>
```
  
Which renders: rendered form containing radio buttons
  
 ![](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html-forms/radioInput%20-%20labeled.png)
  
Notice from the code snippet, radio buttons (like checkboxes) do not display their value. We have an associated label to represent the value of the radio button. To group radio buttons together, we assign them the same name and only one radio button from that group can be selected.

  
## Dropdown list
Radio buttons are great if we want our users to pick one option out of a few visible options, but imagine if we have a whole list of options! This situation could quickly lead to a lot of radio buttons to keep track of.

An alternative solution is to use a dropdown list to allow our users to choose one option from an organized list. Here’s the code to create a dropdown menu:

```
<form>
  <label for="lunch">What's for lunch?</label>
  <select id="lunch" name="lunch">
    <option value="pizza">Pizza</option>
    <option value="curry">Curry</option>
    <option value="salad">Salad</option>
    <option value="ramen">Ramen</option>
    <option value="tacos">Tacos</option>
  </select>
</form>
```
Which renders:rendered dropdown list with the first option showing
![](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html-forms/dropdown%20list%20-%20concealed.png)

And if we click on the field containing the first option, the list is revealed:rendered dropdown list with the all options showing

![](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html-forms/dropdown%20list%20-%20revealed.png)

Notice in the code that we’re using the element select to create the dropdown list. To populate the dropdown list, we add multiple option elements, each with a value attribute. By default, only one of these options can be selected.

The text rendered is the text included between the opening and closing option tags. However, it is the value of the value attribute that is used in form submission (notice the difference in the text and value capitalization). When the form is submitted, the information from this input field will be sent using the name of the select and the value of the chosen option. For instance, if a user selected Pizza from the dropdown list, the information would be sent as "lunch=pizza".
  
## Datalist Input
Even if we have an organized dropdown list, if the list has a lot of options, it could be tedious for users to scroll through the entire list to locate one option. That’s where using the datalist element comes in handy.

The datalist is used with an <input type="text"> element. The <input> creates a text field that users can type into and filter options from the datalist. Let’s go over a concrete example:

```
<form>
  <label for="city">Ideal city to visit?</label>
  <input type="text" list="cities" id="city" name="city">
 
  <datalist id="cities">
    <option value="New York City"></option>
    <option value="Tokyo"></option>
    <option value="Barcelona"></option>
    <option value="Mexico City"></option>
    <option value="Melbourne"></option>
    <option value="Other"></option>  
  </datalist>
</form>
```
Notice, in the code above, we have an <input> that has a list attribute. The <input> is associated to the datalist via the <input>‘s list attribute and the id of the datalist.

From the code provided, the following form is rendered:input field with a label 'Ideal city to visit?'
![](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html-forms/datalist%20-%20concealed.png)

And when field is selected:clicking on the input field reveals a dropdown list
![](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html-forms/datalist%20-%20revealed.png)

While select and datalist share some similarities, there are some major differences. In the associated input element, users can type in the input field to search for a particular option. If none of the options match, the user can still use what they typed in. When the form is submitted, the value of the input‘s name and the value of the option selected, or what the user typed in, is sent as a pair.

## Textarea element
An <input> element with type="text" creates a single row input field for users to type in information. However, there are cases where users need to write in more information, like a blog post. In such cases, instead of using an <input>, we could use textarea.

The textarea element is used to create a bigger text field for users to write more text. We can add the attributes rows and cols to determine the amount of rows and columns for the textarea. Take a look:

```
<form>
  <label for="blog">New Blog Post: </label>
  <br>
  <textarea id="blog" name="blog" rows="5" cols="30">
  </textarea>
</form>
```
In the code above, an empty textarea that is 5 rows by 30 columns is rendered to the page like so: rendered empty textarea element
![](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html-forms/textarea%20-%20blank.png)

If we wanted an even bigger text field, we could click and drag on the bottom right corner to expand it.

When we submit the form, the value of textarea is the text written inside the box. If we want to add a default value to textarea we would include it within the opening and closing tags like so:

```
<textarea>Adding default text</textarea>
```
This code will render a textarea that contains pre-filled text: “Adding default text”.

## Submit Form
Remember, the purpose of a form is to collect information that will be submitted. That’s the role of the submit button — users click on it when they are finished with filling out information in the for> and they’re ready to send it off. Now that we’ve gone over how to create various input elements, let’s now go over how to create a submit button!

To make a submit button in a form, we’re going to use the reliable <input> element and set the type to "submit". For instance:

```
<form>
  <input type="submit" value="Send">
</form>
```
Which renders: rendered submit button
![](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html-forms/submit%20button2.png)

Notice in the code snippet that the value assigned to the <input> shows up as text on the submit button. If there isn’t a value attribute, the default text, Submit shows up on the button.

Let’s now add this element to make our forms complete!
