## What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model, abbreviated DOM, is a powerful tree-like structure that allows programmers to conceptualize hierarchy and access the elements on a web page.

The DOM is one of the better-named acronyms in the field of Web Development. 
- The DOM is a logical tree-like Model that organizes a web page’s HTML Document as an Object.

The DOM is a language-agnostic structure implemented by browsers to allow for web scripting languages, like JavaScript, to access, modify, and update the structure of an HTML web page in an organized way.

For this reason, we like to think of the DOM as the link between an HTML web page and scripting languages.

## Parent Child Relationships in the DOM

Following the metaphor of a family tree, let’s define some key terminology in the DOM hierarchy:

A parent node is the closest connected node to another node in the direction towards the root.

A child node is the closest connected node to another node in the direction away from the root.

Knowing these terms will allow you to understand and discuss the DOM as a tree-like structure. In fact, you will also see this terminology used when referring to the nesting structure of HTML code. Programmers refer to elements nested inside other elements as the children elements and parent elements respectively.

## Nodes and Elements in the DOM

As mentioned, a node is the equivalent of each family member in a family tree. A node is an intersecting point in a tree that also contains data.

There are nine different types of node objects in the DOM tree. 

## Attributes of Element Node

DOM element nodes model elements in an HTML document.

Much like an element in an HTML page, the DOM allows us to access a node’s attributes, such as its class, id, and inline style.

## The document keyword

The document object in JavaScript is the door to the DOM structure. The document allows you to access the root node of the DOM tree. Before you can access a specific element in the page, first you must access the document structure itself. The document allows scripts to access children of the DOM as properties.

For example, if you wanted to access the body element in your script, you could access it as a property of the document by typing document.body. This property will return the body element of that DOM.


## Tweak an Element

When using the DOM in your script to access an HTML element, you also have access to all of that element’s properties.

This includes the ability to modify the contents of the element as well as its attributes and properties— that can range from modifying the text inside a p element to assigning a new background color to a div.

You can access and set the contents of an element with the .innerHTML property.

For example, the following code reassigns the inner HTML of the body element to the text ‘The cat loves the dog’:

```
document.body.innerHTML = 'The cat loves the dog.';
```

The .innerHTML property can also add any valid HTML, including properly formatted elements. The following example assigns an h2 element as a child inside the body element:
  
```
document.body.innerHTML = '<h2>This is a heading</h2>'; 
```
## Select and Modify Elements

What if we wanted to select a specific element? The DOM interface allows us to access a specific element with CSS selectors. CSS selectors define the elements to which a set of CSS rules apply, but we can also use these same selectors to access DOM elements with our script! Selectors can include the name of the tag, a class, or an ID.

The .querySelector() method allows us to specify a CSS selector and then returns the <b>first element</b> that matches that selector. The following code would return the first paragraph in the document.

```
document.querySelector('p');
```

You can also use other CSS selectors such as an element’s . class or its # ID.

Another option, if you want to access elements directly by their id, you can use the aptly named .getElementByID() function:

```
document.getElementById('bio').innerHTML = 'The description';
```
