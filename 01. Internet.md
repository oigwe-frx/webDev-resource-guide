## The Ever-Expanding Network

In 1969, the United States Department of Defense funded the creation of ARPANET, a precursor network to the internet. ARPANET stands for Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. ARPANET connected supercomputing centers run by government agencies and universities.
These institutions wanted to connect their individual networks for large-scale information transfer. However, many of them followed different standards and technical implementations. In the 1970s, the transmission control protocol and internet protocol, otherwise known as TCP/IP, were created to provide standards around the transfer of data that would allow these early networks to communicate with each other.

TCP/IP was researched and specified throughout the 1970s and adopted in the early 1980s. As different networks adopted TCP/IP, the interconnected global network of networks that is today known as the internet was formed.

## World Wide Web

While people today often use the terms internet and world wide web interchangeably, they actually refer to quite different things.

The internet refers to the actual network of connected computing devices. Although the internet was around in the 1980s, there was not an intuitive way for most people to browse the internet. The internet just sent messages produced by one computer and presented them to another computer.

Engagement with the internet changed in 1989 when Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web. The world wide web is a collection of interlinked websites and other web resources. The world wide web, in combination with the rise of web browsers in the 1990s, introduced a user-friendly interface that enabled users to browse multimedia content and interact with other users.

The invention of the world wide web led to the use of the internet in wider society through the 1990s and the creation of a variety of websites that are still in use today.

## Browsers and Servers
As we’ve seen, the internet is a network that links computer devices worldwide, enabling people to share information with one another despite vast distances. But how is information sent from one device to another?

One way of understanding this process is to look at the client-server model. In this model, the client refers to the user’s device or program that is making a request for data. A client can be a browser or application running on a user’s laptop, smartphone, or tablet.

The server is the device or program in that network that waits for incoming requests and sends back data. This might be an in-house server, a rented server at a data center, or cloud server.
