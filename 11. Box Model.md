## The Box Model

The box model comprises the set of properties that define parts of an element that take up space on a web page. The model includes the content area’s size (width and height) and the element’s padding, border, and margin. The properties include:

- width and height: The width and height of the content area.
- padding: The amount of space between the content area and the border.
- border: The thickness and style of the border surrounding the content area and padding.
- margin: The amount of space between the border and the outside edge of the element.

## Padding

Padding is like the space between a picture and the frame surrounding it. 

### 4 Values

```
p.content-header {
  padding: 6px 11px 4px 9px;
}
```
In the example above, the four values 6px 11px 4px 9px correspond to the amount of padding on each side, in a clockwise rotation. In order, it specifies the padding-top value (6px), the padding-right value (11px), the padding-bottom value (4px), and the padding-left value (9px) of the content.

### 3 Values

```
p.content-header {
  padding: 5px 10px 20px;
}
```

If the left and right sides of the content can be equal, the padding shorthand property allows for 3 values to be specified. The first value sets the padding-top value (5px), the second value sets the padding-left and padding-right values (10px), and the third value sets the padding-bottom value (20px).

### 2 Values

```
p.content-header {
  padding: 5px 10px;
}
```

## Margin

Margin refers to the space directly outside of the box. The margin property is used to specify the size of this space.

```
p {
  border: 1px solid aquamarine;
  margin: 20px;
}
```

The code in the example above will place 20 pixels of space on the outside of the paragraph’s box on all four sides. This means that other HTML elements on the page cannot come within 20 pixels of the paragraph’s border.

### Auto

The margin property also lets you center content. However, you must follow a few syntax requirements. Take a look at the following example:

```
div.headline {
  width: 400px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```
In the example above, margin: 0 auto; will center the divs in their containing elements. The 0 sets the top and bottom margins to 0 pixels. The auto value instructs the browser to adjust the left and right margins until the element is centered within its containing element.

In order to center an element, a width must be set for that element. Otherwise, the width of the div will be automatically set to the full width of its containing element, like the body, for example. It’s not possible to center an element that takes up the full width of the page, since the width of the page can change due to display and/or browser window size.

In the example above, the width of the div is set to 400 pixels, which is less than the width of most screens. This will cause the div to center within a containing element that is greater than 400 pixels wide.

## Margin Collapse

As you have seen, padding is space added inside an element’s border, while margin is space added outside an element’s border. One additional difference is that top and bottom margins, also called vertical margins, collapse, while top and bottom padding does not.

Horizontal margins (left and right), like padding, are always displayed and added together. For example, if two divs with ids #div-one and #div-two, are next to each other, they will be as far apart as the sum of their adjacent margins.

```
#img-one {
  margin-right: 20px;
}
 
#img-two {
  margin-left: 20px;
}
```
In this example, the space between the #img-one and #img-two borders is 40 pixels. The right margin of #img-one (20px) and the left margin of #img-two (20px) add to make a total margin of 40 pixels.


Unlike horizontal margins, vertical margins do not add. Instead, the larger of the two vertical margins sets the distance between adjacent elements.

```
#img-one {
  margin-bottom: 30px;
}
 
#img-two {
  margin-top: 20px;
}
```
In this example, the vertical margin between the #img-one and #img-two elements is 30 pixels. Although the sum of the margins is 50 pixels, the margin collapses so the spacing is only dependent on the #img-one bottom margin.


## Minimum and Maximum Height and Width

Because a web page can be viewed through displays of differing screen size, the content on the web page can suffer from those changes in size. To avoid this problem, CSS offers two properties that can limit how narrow or how wide an element’s box can be sized to:

min-width—this property ensures a minimum width of an element’s box.
max-width—this property ensures a maximum width of an element’s box.

```
p {
  min-width: 300px;
  max-width: 600px;
}
```

In the example above, the width of all paragraphs will not shrink below 300 pixels, nor will the width exceed 600 pixels.

Content, like text, can become difficult to read when a browser window is narrowed or expanded. These two properties ensure that content is legible by limiting the minimum and maximum widths of an element.

You can also limit the minimum and maximum height of an element:

min-height — this property ensures a minimum height for an element’s box.
max-height — this property ensures a maximum height of an element’s box.

## Overflow


Sometimes, these components result in an element that is larger than the parent’s containing area.

How can we ensure that we can view all of an element that is larger than its parent’s containing area?

The overflow property controls what happens to content that spills, or overflows, outside its box. The most commonly used values are:

hidden—when set to this value, any content that overflows will be hidden from view.
scroll—when set to this value, a scrollbar will be added to the element’s box so that the rest of the content can be viewed by scrolling.
visible—when set to this value, the overflow content will be displayed outside of the containing element. Note, this is the default value.

## Resetting Defaults

All major web browsers have a default stylesheet they use in the absence of an external stylesheet. These default stylesheets are known as user agent stylesheets. In this case, the term user agent is a technical term for the browser.

User agent stylesheets often have default CSS rules that set default values for padding and margin. This affects how the browser displays HTML elements, which can make it difficult for a developer to design or style a web page.

Many developers choose to reset these default values so that they can truly work with a clean slate.

```
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```
